Bridge Pattern decouples abstractions and implementations
by using two separate inheritance hierarchies,
one for abstraction and one for implementation.
Client uses abstraction hierarchy and implementation
is based on composition. 
Abstraction is maybe a regular class the job is to hide the others.
Example transfer Amount
Implementor has all the other stuff
Check balances, active accounts, make transaction blah  blah
